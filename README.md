# JS Web-September 2023

JavaScript is unique in that it allows the same programming language and tools to be applied to the back-end and front-end elements of an application. In the JS Web module, students will learn about developing server-side applications with Node.js and Express.js, as well as some of today's most popular technologies for building user interfaces. The module will also focus on the architecture and structuring of Single Page Applications and retrieving data from a REST service using queries. During the training, students will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. They learn data views and templates, models, components, data binding, multi-view handling, routing, extracting data from a REST service, and much more. The module emphasizes many hands-on exercises that will engage students in real-world web page development projects, implementing snippets of websites, and creating complete modern websites with good design, modern structure, and mobile support.
